# 2020 SolarWinds Hack

- Name: Aravinth TM
- Registration Number: 19BCE7415

Recently a supply chain attack trojanized SolarWinds Orion softare to
target organisations around the world. Victims include several US
Government organisations and several Fortune 500 companies. This was
possible due to a gross lack of security procedures within SolarWinds to
secure software distribution pipelines.

## About SolarWinds Orion Software suite

SolarWinds Orion Software is a non-free, proprietary network performance monitoring tool for
Windows platform that has the following capabilities:

- Performance monitor
- Traffic analyzer
- Configuration manager
- User device tracker
- Server performance monitor

It is a software that runs with top privileges.

## Discovery

On December 8. 2020, FireEye an Independent security team conducted an
audit on it's own infrastructure, supposedly to contain a breach that
they were experiencing.

They discovered that `SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll`, a
SolarWinds digitally-signed component of Orion Software suite contained
a trojan horse.

## Infection:

Attackers infiltrated SolarWinds's build system and planted the malware
which would further be distributed to all their customers. This typical
of [supply chain
attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack). The infected SolarWinds
software was then distributed via their website. Update package
`CORE-2019.4.5220.20574-SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp (02af7cec58b9a5da1c542b5a32151ba1)` was the first update that contained
`SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll`, a malicious software plugin.
All updates from March 2020 and June 2020 contained this malicious
plugin.

Authorized system administers download and install updates to SolarWinds
Orion software that span large networks.

## Characteristics

- It has a HTTP based backdoor that communicated with third-party servers. The
  malware has code execution capabilities - It contacts C2(command and
  Control) to retrieve "Jobs" to run on victim machine.

- The malware remains dormant for a period of two weeks and attempts to
  query `CNAME` of a subdomain of `avsvmcloud dot com`. The result is an
  other domain name which points to a C2. A full list of C2 domains was
  published by FireEye
  [here](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures/blob/main/all-snort.rules).

- The malicious traffic is masqueraded as Orion Improvement Program
  protocol, a SolarWinds proprietary protocol to collect telemetry on the
  product.

- All reconnaissance results are stored with legitimate plugin
  configuration files toe evade detections

## Victims

Solar winds stated that 33,0000 of their 300,000 customers use Orion.
Some of the notable organisations are listed below:

## Prevention

1. Freely publish source code: A network monitoring tool can listen in
   on all network chatter so it requires top privileges. No non-free,
   proprietary program should be top privileges. If sources were freely
   published, several actors along the supply chain would validate and
   audit changes before publishing it further downstream. This is
   typical of how free software organisations like GNU/Linux
   Distributions and BSD variants function.

2. Reproducible builds: Supply chain attacks are becoming increasingly
   popular. A supply chain compromise could lead to compromise of all
   parties that use that software. The best way to prevent against these
   types of attacks is offering reproducible builds. Doing so would
   enable everyone that has access to source code to independently
   compile and verify the signatures of officially distributed binaries.

3. Securing build environments: build environment security is critical.
   When an organisation doesn't have enough resources to monitor their
   build environment, they should consider outsourcing software build
   pipelines to commercially available solutions. These solutions have
   dedicated teams that monitor their infrastructure round the clock to
   protect against intrusions. In an increasingly cloud-favouring
   climate, the is the appropriate way to distribute software.

## Investigation

SolarWinds claims that Russian government
sponsored hackers were responsible for planting the malware.

Karspersky said that the malware has characteristics that resemble
Kazur, which is believed to be created by an Estonian intelligence group
called Turla, which has links to Russian federal security service, FSB.

The Russian government has denied involvement.
